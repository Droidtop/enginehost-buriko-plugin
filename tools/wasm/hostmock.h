 * hostmock.h - a host-side stand-in for the browser half of the WebAssembly
 *              back end's file transport (src/os/wasm/host.c)
 *
 * Implements the WasmHostJs_* functions host.c would get from client.js and
 * server.js, against a directory on the local disk, with the server's
 * semantics (relative paths, case-insensitive components, ranged reads,
 * read-only).  Used by tests/wasmfs.c and by the simulator
 * tools/wasm/fakebrowser.c, both built with -Itools/wasmstub.
