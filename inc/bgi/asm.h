 * asm.h - the assembler and disassembler of Buriko programs ("*._bp");
 *         implemented in src/asm/decode.c, dis.c, as.c and the generated
 *         opnames.c
 *
 * A program file is a 16-byte header (the code offset 0x10, the size of
 * what follows, two zero words) and one area holding the bytecode and the
 * data it refers to (strings, tables), all addressed by offsets from the
 * area's start (docs/vm.md).  This module turns such a file into an
 * assembler listing with labels and back:
 *
 *   * Asm_Decode: one instruction with its operands, for the listing, the
 *     debugger and the analysis;
 *   * Dis_Program: the whole file - the code is found by following the
 *     flow from the entry and every jump target, the data by what the
 *     code refers to - as text the assembler accepts;
 *   * Asm_Assemble: the text back into a file, in as many passes as the
 *     relative operands need to settle.
 *
 * Every function takes the engine generation (EngineGen_t, version.h) to
 * work under: it decides which opcodes exist, what a reused number means,
 * how the conditional jump is encoded (1.667+) and the layout of tagged
 * pointers.  GEN_COUNT stands for "any": every opcode of every build is
 * accepted and a reused number has its newest meaning.
 *
 * The listing's syntax is described in docs/asm.md.  Mnemonics come from
 * the opcode tables of the reimplementation (opnames.c, generated from
 * them); an opcode without a name is written as
 * `family.0xHH` (`sys.0x5F`), and an opcode the selected engine
 * generation does not define is still assembled, with a warning.
