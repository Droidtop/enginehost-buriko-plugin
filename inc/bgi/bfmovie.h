 * bfmovie.h - "BF_Movie_______" frame sequences (1.69/472 on; decoded by
 *             src/core/bfmovie.c, managed by src/gfx/bmseq.c)
 *
 * The container behind the "90 F4" .. "90 F7" instructions: a short
 * animation (an animated bust-shot, a CG sequence, an eye-catch) stored as
 * one key frame and delta frames, decoded straight into a bitmap slot.  The
 * frames of the games examined (PrismRhythm's data02007.arc) are of the
 * in-memory type 0.  Types 0x10000 / 0x10001 are the streamed variant
 * (frames read from the archive on demand), which has not been met in the
 * data and is not decoded here.
 *
 * File layout (little-endian, byte offsets):
 *   0x00 "BF_Movie_______\0"       0x10 type (0 here)
 *   0x14 width   0x18 height       0x1C bits per pixel (24 / 32)
 *   0x20 pixel mode of the target slot (1 RGB32, 2 ARGB32)
 *   0x24 frame rate                0x28 frame count
 *   0x2C .. 0x3F zero
 *   0x40 frame offsets (one per frame, from the start of the file; a frame
 *        ends where the next begins, the last at the end of the file)
 *
 * A frame: varint N, 256 varint Huffman weights, then the bit stream (bits
 * taken from the least significant end of each byte) of N symbols.  The N
 * bytes decoded are a 32-bit length L followed by a run-length stream of
 * alternating (varint fill, varint copy) pairs - the fill writes 0x80 - that
 * expands to L bytes.  Frame 0 holds the whole picture as rows padded to 4
 * bytes, each byte the difference to the average of its left and upper
 * neighbours (the CompressedBG filter); the other frames hold a bit per 8 x 8
 * block (set: the block changes), eight row masks per changed block and a
 * pixel stream in which each pixel of a changed block is either (mask bit
 * set) the previous frame's pixel plus a delta per channel, or (bit clear)
 * a byte 0x80 for a transparent pixel, else a (dx, dy) displacement copying
 * the previous frame's pixel at that offset.
