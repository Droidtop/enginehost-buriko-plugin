 * wavemaster.h - the entry points of the statically linked "Wave Master"
 *                sound library that the sound manager (bgi/sound.h) calls;
 *                the reimplementation is src/snd/wm/ (wavemaster.c, bgm.c,
 *                se.c, record.c, voice.c) with the container and codecs in
 *                src/snd/bw/.
 *
 * Every entry takes the library's lock around the operation.  Inside, the
 * original raises C++ exceptions carrying an int code that the locked
 * wrappers turn into the return value:
 *   0      ok
 *   1      already initialised              5     the sound device could not be opened
 *   0xc    file not found                   0xe   not a BW file (or an unknown codec)
 *   0x13   the slot has nothing loaded      0x14  the library is not running
 *   0x15   bad channel / slot number        0x16  the sound could not be loaded
 *   0x17   the sound could not be started
 *
 * Music plays on 16 channels (0 .. 15) streamed from a file or an archive
 * entry; the "pair" forms take an intro and a loop part (two Vorbis files,
 * the loop part repeating while `mode` is non-zero - the same name twice
 * makes a single looping file).  Sound effects live in 64 slots (0 .. 63)
 * and are decoded completely when loaded.  Volumes are 0 .. 0x80, pans
 * 0 .. 0x80 with 0x40 centred.  `gain` multiplies every decoded sample;
 * the engine always passes 1.0.
 *
 * The 20 ms fade timer of the original is a window timer; the message pump
 * drives it here through Wm_TimerPoll().
