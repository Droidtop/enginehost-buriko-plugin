 * bpc.h - the decompiler and compiler of the programs ("*._bp"): the
 *         C-like source the system programs were written in, recovered
 *         from the bytecode and compiled back to it; implemented in
 *         src/bpc/ (bpdec.c, bpcomp.c)
 *
 * The programs come from one compiler whose output follows fixed
 * shapes - a frame of locals below the frame pointer, the arguments of a
 * function pushed right to left and of an engine instruction left to
 * right, conditions as chains of conditional jumps, every return through
 * one exit - and the decompiler turns those shapes back into functions,
 * declarations, expressions and the usual statements (docs/bpc.md
 * describes the source).  What it cannot express exactly, or what does
 * not come back identical when compiled, is written as an `__asm` block
 * of listing lines, so that the source always compiles to the input: the
 * compiler produces an assembler listing (docs/asm.md) and assembles it,
 * and the disassembler's analysis (Dis_Analyze, asm.h) is what the
 * decompiler starts from.
