# OpenBGI

OpenBGI is an open-source reimplementation, in C99, of Ethornell's
"Buriko General Interpreter" (BGI), the visual-novel engine.  It is
reverse-engineered function by function from the `tayutama.exe` build
(ver 1.69, build 444.2, with the "Wave Master" sound library) and
extended to run the scripts of the engine's other builds, from ver 1.58
to ver 1.669 (`docs/versions.md`).  Every function keeps the original's
results for the same inputs, including its result codes and quirks.  The
Windows specifics sit behind an OS layer (`inc/bgi/os.h`) with a Win32
back end, a Linux back end (X11, FreeType, ALSA) and a WebAssembly back
end (a canvas, the game's files over a websocket; `docs/wasm.md`).

## Building

    make              Linux (gcc or clang; X11, Xext, FreeType, optionally
                      ALSA, fontconfig and libvorbisfile via pkg-config)
    make win          Windows through MinGW (i686-w64-mingw32-gcc)
    make wasm         the browser through Emscripten (emcc) -> bin/wasm/openbgi.html;
                      `node tools/wasm/server.js <game dir>` serves it (docs/wasm.md)
    make tools        the command-line tools: bin/bpasm, the assembler /
                      disassembler of the game's programs (docs/asm.md), and
                      bin/bgiscn, the decompiler / compiler of the scenario
                      files, for translations (docs/scenario.md)
    make check        syntax-check every translation unit with -pedantic
    make test         build and run tests/
    make clean

Plain `make` only, no autotools / CMake.  Objects go to `obj/<platform>/`,
binaries to `bin/`.  `VORBIS=vorbisfile|stb|none` selects the Vorbis
decoder, `OPT=...` the optimisation flags; `docs/building.md` has the
details, the optional dependencies and the state of the Windows and
WebAssembly builds.

## Running

    cd <the game's directory>   # ipl._bp, system.arc, sysprg.arc, ...
    /path/to/bin/bgi [arguments as for the original]

or just `bin/bgi` from anywhere: started outside a game directory (no
`system.arc` or `ipl._bp` where it runs, no path given) the engine opens
a "Select game" window - the games it has run before, or a directory
to pick, with the game it finds there named; "Advanced" uncovers the
engine profile and extra options, Launch starts it and records the
directory in `games.json` for the next time.

The engine build a game needs is chosen from the game's `ipl._bp` through
`games.json`, which also holds the profiles themselves: the engine writes
the default one next to `bgi` on its first run (a game's own directory
may carry one too) - see `docs/versions.md`.  `--engine=NAME` forces a
profile, `--list-engines` prints them, `--games=PATH` names another
table, `--enable=FAM:OP` / `--disable=FAM:OP` override single opcodes;
these options are removed before the rest of the command line reaches
the original's parser.  The original's own options such as `"Do not use
mutex."` (needed for a second instance in the same directory) work as
before.

A game copied straight from its disc carries the disc marker, a 16-byte
file named like the product (`Tayutama`, `HanairoHeptagram`, ...), and
every boot program quits at once when it finds that file next to the
game - the disc is meant to be installed, not run.  The engine hides the
marker from the scripts, so such a copy starts; `--disc-marker` gives
the original's behaviour back.

The engine's own messages (script errors, notices, the installer) are
shown in English; `--lang=ja` or `BGI_LANG=ja` selects the Japanese
originals, which stay in the binary (`tools/messages.txt` holds both, the
text engine's character tables and the player-facing dialog labels are
never translated).  Message boxes raised by the game's own scripts (the
"B0 80 .. 82" instructions and the installer prompts of the `_bp`
programs) carry whatever text the script passes and are marked with a
"(script)" suffix in their caption, so that an untranslated box can be
told from an engine message.  The window title is the game's own
followed by " - OpenBGI".

The same binary looks inside the game's archives: `--list=ARCHIVE`
prints every entry with what it is (a CompressedBG image and its size, a
BW sound and its codec, a program, a compiled scenario, a BF_Movie);
`--extract=ARCHIVE` writes the entries into a directory (`--out=DIR`,
default the archive's name without its extension) as the engine sees
them after the DSC layer, with `--raw` as stored, with `--convert` turned
into common formats (images as .bmp, sounds as .wav - Vorbis only with a
decoder built in -, BF_Movie frames as one .bmp each); `--entry=NAME`
picks one entry.  `bin/bpasm` (`make tools`) disassembles and assembles
the programs (`docs/asm.md`) and decompiles them to the C-like source
they were written in and compiles that back (`docs/bpc.md`);
`bin/bgiscn` does the same for the scenario files of every build (the
1.494+ containers, the headerless files of 1.66 / 1.69, the 16-bit
scenes of 1.64) and repacks the archive, which is how a game's text is
translated (`docs/scenario.md`).

`--debug` opens the debugger with the game (`--debug=pause` holds the
scripts until F5); F12 in the game's window opens and closes it at any
time.  It shows the threads with their stacks and listings, the loaded
programs, the bitmap slots, the display objects, the sound channels, the
memory areas and a log, and pauses, steps and breaks the VM
(`docs/debugger.md`).  Not in the WebAssembly build.

The Windows build needs no Japanese system locale and no locale
emulator: it calls the wide-character API of Windows and converts the
games' Shift-JIS file names, titles, messages and font names itself, and
a game may sit in a directory whose name Shift-JIS cannot spell
(`docs/os_layer.md`, "Strings").

The Linux build keeps its settings (the original's registry values) in
`~/.config/bgi/`.  Fonts: `BGI_FONT_GOTHIC`, `BGI_FONT_MINCHO` or
`BGI_FONT` name a font file to use instead of what fontconfig / the font
directories offer for "ＭＳ ゴシック" / "ＭＳ 明朝".

`CONVENTIONS.md` has the naming, formatting and commenting rules.  Of the
docs, `building.md` covers the builds and their
optional dependencies, `vm.md` the VM, `versions.md` the engine builds
and the profiles, `bfmovie.md` the frame-sequence movies of the later
builds, `sound.md` the Wave Master library and the BW container,
`os_layer.md` the OS interface, `wasm.md` the browser build, `asm.md` the
assembler / disassembler and its listing format, `scenario.md` the
scenario files, their source language and the translation workflow,
`debugger.md` the debugger, `panel_system.md`, `particle_rain.md` and
`child_edit_dialogs.md` the subsystems they name.

Development switches (environment): `BGI_MSGBOX_STDERR=1` (message boxes
print and take their default button), `BGI_TRACE`, `BGI_TRACE_FROM`,
`BGI_TRACE_LAST`, `BGI_TRACE_OPS` (instruction traces, see
`src/vm/trace.c`), `BGI_OPSTAT=<file>` (the executed opcodes),
`BGI_INPUT_DEBUG=1`, `BGI_SND_DEBUG=1` (music opens, loop restarts),
`BGI_DEBUG_OVERLAY=1` (the debugger over the game's picture instead of
in a window of its own).
